# Learning Process
We do not need to learn every programming language to understand how to read their code. All of them follow the same principles which R. D. Tennent initially defined:

1.  The Principle of Abstraction
2.  The Principle of Correspondence
3.  The Principle of Data Type Completeness

 there are generally two types of people.

-   Those that do not know anything.
-   Those who think they do not know anything.

Occam's Razor: -   `The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.`

Such talents, or rather the ability to solve specific problems and challenges with high efficiency, arise from the `constant or persistent` confrontation with the corresponding situations and the problems that arise.The confrontation expands the so-called comfort zone and repertoire,

A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation.

The `Pareto principle` states that with 20% of the effort, we can achieve 80% of the effect. we can learn something new in 20 hours, even working on it for just 45 minutes per day

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_pyramid

There are many different ways to stay motivated. An excellent method that works very well is by recognizing success, even the most minor successes. We must recognize our successes and see that we have made progres

Progress is noticeable when the question that tortured us has lost its meaning.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_free_will

Before we decide to achieve a specific goal, we must become clear about our desires. In as much detail as possible, we should explain to ourselves what we want and how it must feel to achieve our goal. This process can also be thought of as dreaming, where we imagine a situation we would like to be in. Unfortunately, most people stop dreaming shortly after they start because they do not see a way to get there.

-   `Fear is a state and the product of our imagination of the future and its consequences where the present is suppressed.`

The results of a meta-analysis of over 200 studies with more than 40,000 participants show that over 90 percent of people are significantly more successful in achieving their dreams by `setting challenging and specific goals`.
What do we want to achieve? Do we want to...:

-   Pass an exam?
-   Obtain a certification?
-   Learn and master new skills?
-   Or impress and please others?

There are many resources available for documentation. We recommend a tool called `CherryTree`.

It is essential to get clarity, and a picture is worth a thousand words. For this, we can use a tool called `FlameShot` that makes it easier for us to take screenshots and edit them directly.

1.  It is beneficial to put ourselves in the position of our readers. This will make it much easier for us to design the documentation.
2.  Avoid repetition and ambiguity.
3.  Make documentation as easy to read as possible. No one wants to read the documentation that is difficult to understand or follow.

It is essential to differentiate between `focus` and `attention` because they are not the same. `Attention` refers to the **momentum**, as it is happening right now, and you are reading this text. However, the `focus` is on the topic you are dealing with at the moment

`Focusing is the purposeful and deliberate alignment to a specific goal`.

Information security is a vast subject. We will not be able to absorb all the information at once. We will often come back to topics and repeat what we are missing. This is a normal process.

Make sure that you feel comfortable and ready to learn new things.

`Yerkes-Dodson` law, which describes the cognitive performance as a function of the level of stress/nervousness.

When we leave the so-called `comfort zone`, we enter a situation or field where we have little or no experience. This kind of uncertainty lowers our ability to think and has a powerful impact on our thought processes, which, in turn, slows us down.

The fact that small children do not exhibit such uncertainty is interesting.

`They love to try out something new all the time and are not afraid or uncertain of making mistakes.`

After all, `mistakes are an essential part of the learning process`, and we should always keep it in mind.

Now imagine you are standing at the entrance in front of a massive dark forest in the middle of the night. This forest is so dense that no daylight can get through the treetops. To the left and right of this forest, some cliffs are much too steep to climb down, and we know that somewhere in this forest, there is the one thing we want to have.  
Will you go inside and look for it?  
Common sense would do anything not to.  
  
But what if the thing you want is a hundred yards further into the forest, and it is brightly lit?  
That is the thing that will fulfill you the way we have always wanted it to.  
Would you risk it now?

## Fear
-   `People fear what might happen in the future while not considering the present`.
[https://youtu.be/VsTBCQ2MnRM](https://youtu.be/VsTBCQ2MnRM)

Imaginary fear is an emotional state that keeps us from having the best experiences and prevents us from moving forward on the desired path. Even if we want to be excellent penetration testers, most beginners are afraid to put their maximum energy into it because of the imaginary fear of failure.

However, if we find ourselves feeling such fear, then we should answer the following question in as much detail as possible:

-   "Which of the mentioned reasons are actually real right now?"

 write it down and hang it on the wall where we can always see it:

-   `The difference between a winner and a loser is that the winner has lost more often than the loser`.

## Mindset
For example, when we catch ourselves thinking thoughts like "I cannot," we can easily change them from bad feelings to good feelings.

The only thing we have to do is to add the word "yet."

-   I cannot do this "yet."
-   This is not for me "yet."
-   I do not understand this "yet."
All obstacles and feelings that prevent us from doing so are temporary. These feelings pass, but the goal remains.

Another factor often perceived as an obstacle is comparing skill, talent, and passion. However, we have already learned what constitutes talent.

-   Talent is a strongly developed skill with high efficiency.
-   Skill is the ability to manage or solve something well.
-   Passion is an emotional commitment to a particular area.
## Pressure
-   Only the person who has taken the exact same journey as you can evaluate you and your decisions. Everything else is only assumptions.

## Questioning
The most important and most difficult thing in any situation is not the search for the right answer but the search for the right question.
-   A `rough question` would be, for example, "How can I hack X?"
-   A `precise question` would be: "How can I use the server's SMB service to identify its existing user accounts?"

`Relationship-Oriented-Questioning Model` (`ROQ`)
Your Position	This describes the position we are in and our view.
The Object	The object is the core element of the question. The main component of our sentence takes the meaning out of the question.
Known	This information is known to us.
Unknown	This information is not known to us.
Other Position(s)	This component describes the position of other persons.

1.  We need to find out the core element of the question and insert it as the object.
2.  We must have at least two components defined in the model. More than two components are optional.
A right question is a precise question that allows us to establish the relationships between the components, to understand them, and to take us one step further to the required answer.
## Frustration
Often it helps to listen to our thoughts from a 3rd-person perspective or imagine that our best friend expresses these thoughts. With that, we gain some distance from the feeling of being affected by it, which makes it easier to construct an objective opinion and judgment about it.
![[Pasted image 20240512000141.png]]
we need to `consciously but in a controlled way`, place ourselves in situations where a particular frustration can be assumed. It is important to note that this must be done in a controlled and conscious way. It must, therefore, be our conscious decision to deal with the upcoming situation.
Do not forget that this feeling of frustration is `temporary`. This means that when we feel frustrated, it will pass.
# Linux Fundamentals
## Cheatsheet
`Everything is a file`

All configuration files for the various services running on the Linux operating system are stored in one or more text files.

`Small, single-purpose programs`

Linux offers many different tools that we will work with, which can be combined to work together.

`Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks`

The integration and combination of different tools enable us to carry out many large and complex tasks, such as processing or filtering specific data results.

`Avoid captive user interfaces`

Linux is designed to work mainly with the shell (or terminal), which gives the user greater control over the operating system.

`Configuration data stored in a text file`

An example of such a file is the `/etc/passwd` file, which stores all users registered on the system.

**Path**

**Description**

`/`

The top-level directory is the root filesystem and contains all of the files required to boot the operating system before other filesystems are mounted as well as the files required to boot the other filesystems. After boot, all of the other filesystems are mounted at standard mount points as subdirectories of the root.

`/bin`

Contains essential command binaries.

`/boot`

Consists of the static bootloader, kernel executable, and files required to boot the Linux OS.

`/dev`

Contains device files to facilitate access to every hardware device attached to the system.

`/etc`

Local system configuration files. Configuration files for installed applications may be saved here as well.

`/home`

Each user on the system has a subdirectory here for storage.

`/lib`

Shared library files that are required for system boot.

`/media`

External removable media devices such as USB drives are mounted here.

`/mnt`

Temporary mount point for regular filesystems.

`/opt`

Optional files such as third-party tools can be saved here.

`/root`

The home directory for the root user.

`/sbin`

This directory contains executables used for system administration (binary system files).

`/tmp`

The operating system and many programs use this directory to store temporary files. This directory is generally cleared upon system boot and may be deleted at other times without any warning.

`/usr`

Contains executables, libraries, man files, etc.

`/var`

This directory contains variable data files such as log files, email in-boxes, web application related files, cron files, and more.

The most commonly used shell in Linux is the `Bourne-Again Shell` (`BASH`),

 redirecting the file descriptor for the errors (`FD 2 - STDERR`) to "`/dev/null`." This way, we redirect the resulting errors to the "null device," which discards all data.
##  Find
 ```shell-session
find /etc/ -name shadow 2>/dev/null
```
## Network Configuration
-   Discretionary access control (DAC)
-   Mandatory access control (MAC)
-   Role-based access control (RBAC)

When working with Ubuntu, you can configure local network interfaces using the `ifconfig` or the `ip` command.

It is important to note that each penetration test or security assessment must be performed from a freshly installed VM to avoid including security-relevant details from another client environment in our reports by accident or retaining client-sensitive data for significant lengths of time.

A `hypervisor` is software that allows us to create and run virtual machines (VMs). It will enable us to use our host computer (desktop or laptop) to run multiple VMs by virtually sharing memory and processing resources.  
VMs on a hypervisor run isolated from the primary operating system, which offers a layer of isolation and protection between our production network and vulnerable networks, such as Hack The Box, or when connecting to client environments from a VM (though VM breakout vulnerabilities do arise from time to time).

The `OVA` file is a pre-built virtual appliance that contains an `OVF` XML file that specifies the VM hardware settings and a `VMDK`, which is the virtual disk that the operating system is installed on. An `OVA` is pre-built and therefore can be rapidly deployed to get up and running quicker.

On a Linux system, the shell is a program that takes input from the user via the keyboard and passes these commands to the operating system to perform a specific function. In the early days of computing, the shell was the only interface available for interacting with systems.

Most Linux systems use a program called [Bash (Bourne Again Shell)](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html) as a shell program to interact with the operating system. Bash is an enhanced version of [sh](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sh.1p.html), the Unix systems' original shell program

There are three main types of shell connections:

Reverse shell	Initiates a connection back to a "listener" on our attack box.
Bind shell	"Binds" to a specific port on the target host and waits for a connection from our attack box.
Web shell	Runs operating system commands via the web browser, typically not interactive or semi-interactive. It can also be used to run single commands (i.e., leveraging a file upload vulnerability and uploading a PHP script to run a single command.

# Penetration Testing Process
![[Pasted image 20240707211833.png]]

## Precautionary Measure
- Obtain written consent from the owner or authorized representative of the computer or network being tested
- Conduct the testing within the scope of the consent obtained only and respect any limitations specified
- Take measures to prevent causing damage to the systems or networks being tested
- Do not access, use or disclose personal data or any other information obtained during the testing without permission
- Do not intercept electronic communications without the consent of one of the parties to the communication
- Do not conduct testing on systems or networks that are covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) without proper authorization
## Process
directed sequence of events.
 A deterministic process is a process in which each state is causally dependent on and determined by other previous states and events.
 A stochastic process is one in which one state follows from other states only with a certain probability.
We use the definition of the penetration testing process from the social sciences to represent `a course of events connected` with `deterministic processes`.

A penetration testing process is defined by successive steps and events performed by the penetration tester to find a path to the predefined objective.
## Stages
### Pre-Engagement
educating the client and adjusting the contract. All necessary tests and their components are strictly defined and contractually recorded.

1.  Scoping questionnaire
    
2.  Pre-engagement meeting
    
3.  Kick-off meeting
It is essential to know `who in the company is permitted` to contract us for a penetration test. Because we cannot accept such an order from everyone
 [Computer Misuse Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/contents)
### Information Gathering
-   Open-Source Intelligence
-   Infrastructure Enumeration
-   Service Enumeration
-   Host Enumeration
### Vulnerability Assessment
we analyze the results from our `Information Gathering` stage, looking for known vulnerabilities in the systems, applications, and various versions of each to discover possible attack vectors
### Exploitation
### Post-Exploitation
we may try to escalate our privileges to obtain the highest possible rights and hunt for sensitive data


### Lateral Movement
movement within the internal network of our target company to access additional hosts at the same or a higher privilege level.
1.  Pivoting: access inaccessible systems via an intermediary system.
2.  Evasive Testing
3.  Information Gathering
4.  Vulnerability Assessment
5.  (Privilege) Exploitation
6.  Post-Exploitation
### Proof of Concept
we document, step-by-step, the steps we took to achieve network compromise or some level of access.
### Post-Engagement
 detailed documentation is prepared for both administrators and client company management to understand the severity of the vulnerabilities found.
  - Cleanup
- Documentation and Reporting
- Report Review Meeting
- Deliverable Acceptance
- Post Remediation Testing

As we continually grow our technical skillset, we should always look for ways to improve our soft skills and become more well-rounded professional consultants. In the end, the `client will usually remember interactions` during the assessment, communication, and how they were treated/valued by the firm they engage, `not the fancy exploit chain the pentester pulled off to pwn their systems`.

Take this time to self-reflect and work on continuous improvement in all aspects of your role as a professional penetration tester.

## Practice
we can pick out a few more modules to increase our knowledge, machines to practice on, and Prolabs or Endgames to really put ourselves to the test. The numbers below are a good starting example:

-   2x Modules
-   3x Retired Machines
-   5x Active Machines
-   1x Pro Lab / Endgame

Here is a good blueprint for tackling a module:

**Step**

**Task**

1.

3.

Complete the module

4.

Start the module exercises from scratch

5.

While solving the exercises again, take notes

6.

Create technical documentation based on the notes

7.

Create non-technical documentation based on the notes

# Incident Handling Process
# MacOS Fundamentals
we can open a new `Finder` window by clicking [`CMD+N`], and then we can easily navigate to the folder we want by using the keyboard arrows and [`CMD+↑`]/[`CMD+↓`] to go in and out of folders.

However, relying on the `Spotlight` search bar can still be much more efficient. We can quickly bring up our search bar with the [`CMD+SPACEBAR`] shortcut or by clicking on the magnifying glass key on our keyboards 'usually on `F4`'. Next, we can type the name of any file, folder, or application and select it from the results to open it. Relying on this method, instead of manually finding each file/folder/application by manual mouse clicks, can save us hours of our life

 duplicate any item by holding the `option` key while dragging them.
### View Root Directory

One way to view the `root` directory is to launch the `Finder` app from the Dock, click on the `Go` Pane at the top, select `Computer` & click on `Storage`.
Another way to open the root directory is to launch the `Finder` app from Dock; enter the keyboard shortcut `Command + Shift + G`, type `/`, and hit `Go`.
You may also go up and down directories in Finder using the `Command` with the `up` and `down` arrows.

### View Hidden Files and Folders
Hold down `Command + Shift + .` (full stop/period)

## Using Preview Pane
Enable `Preview Pane` inside `Finder` to look at the file preview.

1.  Launch the `Finder` app from the Dock.
2.  Click on the `View` Pane at the top & select `Show Preview`.

The `man hier` command is also helpful for getting an initial understanding of the standard Unix folder structure.
